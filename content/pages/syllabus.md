Course Description
------------------

The Workshop on Deliberative Democracy and Dispute Resolution, sponsored by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School and [_The Flora and William Hewlett Foundation_](http://www.hewlett.org/), is a two-day conference that brings together dispute resolution professionals and political theorists in the field of deliberative democracy. Invited guests will participate in one of four panel discussions built around a hypothetical scenario depicting a difficult moment in democratic practice. The panels will be comprised of three dispute resolution professionals and three political theorists. One of the five co-organizers will moderate. The participants will submit two pages of reactions to the workshop, which will be compiled and bound with selected readings on the topics discussed. The two-day workshop will be filmed and a summary video will be made available through the Program on Negotiation Clearinghouse.
